## üöÄ Overview

**<ConfessCode/>** is a full-stack Next.js application designed as a safe and anonymous space for users to share confessions. It features a unique "hacker terminal" aesthetic, client-side anonymity management, AI-powered content moderation, and a complete admin dashboard for content management.

The platform is built to be secure and private by design‚Äîit never stores user credentials, passwords, or personal information. Anonymity is managed through a locally stored hash, ensuring user privacy.

## ‚ú® Core Features

- **True Anonymity**: No user accounts or logins. Activation is done via a one-time secret key, generating a client-side anonymous hash.
- **AI-Powered Moderation**: Confessions are automatically reviewed by a Genkit AI flow to check for toxic content before being sent to admins.
- **Interactive Feed**: Users can browse approved confessions, like, dislike, and comment on them.
- **Nested Comments**: Engage in discussions with threaded replies.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A secure area for administrators to review, approve, reject, or delete confessions and ban malicious users.
- **Shareable Confessions**: Easily share a confession as an image on social media using the Web Share API.
- **PWA Ready**: The application is a fully installable Progressive Web App (PWA) for a native-like experience on any device.
- **Engaging UI/UX**: A unique "hacker terminal" theme with glitch effects, typing animations, and custom sounds for an immersive experience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/confess-code.git
    cd confess-code
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following keys. You will need to create a Supabase project to get these values.

    ```env
    # Supabase URL and Keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key

    # Secret key for the admin dashboard
    ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_admin_key

    # (Optional) Google AI API Key for Genkit
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

4.  **Set up the Supabase database:**
    You will need to run the SQL scripts located in the `/supabase` directory of this project to set up the necessary tables (`confessions`, `comments`, `activations`, etc.) and database functions.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

## üîë Accessing the App

-   **User Access**: Navigate to the homepage and click "Activate." Use the default key `WELCOME` to generate your anonymous identity.
-   **Admin Access**: Navigate to `/admin/login` and enter the `ADMIN_SECRET_KEY` you defined in your `.env` file.
